# Building
1. Install nvm: `brew install nvm` and follow the instructions

2. Install Node.js 12.0: `nvm install 12.0`

3. Build the extension: `./build.sh`

# Getting started
      
1. [Get/Install from the VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=keesschollaart.vscode-home-assistant)

2. Make sure the Language is set to 'Home Assistant' using the language picker:

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keesschollaart81/vscode-home-assistant/dev/assets/select_language.png" width="250"/>

    and/or pin it via a `./vscode/settings.json` file in your Home Assistant configuration folder:

    ``` yaml
    {
        "files.associations": {
            "*.yaml": "home-assistant"
        }
    }
    ```
    
    [The VS Code docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/overview#_changing-the-language-for-the-selected-file) also explain how to set the 'Home Assistant' language as default for '.yaml' or for a workspace (via a settings file).

3. Configure the connection to Home Assistant (more info in the [Configuration section below](#Configuration))

# Features

## Completion & Validation for Configuration & Lovelace Schema

Most of the scheme's of Home Assistant will be validated and things like properties, values and enums will be auto-completed. This extension understands the behaviour of Home Assistant '!include...' behaviour and use this to provide scoped validation for all your files.

# Configuration

After installation, this extension needs your...
- **Home Assistant Root URL** and a
- **Long Lived Access Token**

...to be able to connect to your Home Assistant Server.

There are 2 ways to get this done:

1. Via the default VS Code Settings UI

    Set the values with the default settings editor of VS Code: to open the VS Code settings, go to (cmd+shift+p) *'Preferences: Open Settings (UI)'*, then go to *'Extensions'* and then *'Home Assistant'*. Please note the difference between 'User Settings' and 'Workspace Settings', by default the extension sets them on User-level but they can be overridden at workspace level.

2. Via Environment Variables

    Set the `HASS_SERVER` and `HASS_TOKEN` Environment Variables. This is convenient when you're using both this extension and the [Home Assistant CLI](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant-cli). The extension will only use these Environment Variables when you have not set any setting in VS Code.

    Remember the scope of your environment variables differs per OS. Usually for this to work, you need to start VS Code from the from the prompt where the environment variables are set.

# Telemetry

This extension collects telemetry data to help us build a better experience for
using VS Code with Home Assistant. We use [vscode-extension-telemetry](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-telemetry),
which reports the following data:

- Extension name
- Extension version
- Machine ID and session ID from VS Code
- Operating system
- Platform version

Additionally, if the language server fails to activate, we report the diagnostic
data the language server produces. The extension respects the `telemetry.enableTelemetry`
setting, which you can learn more about at VS Code's
[telemetry FAQ](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting).
